# Arguments for LUYA

## Advantages

- building upon the solid and popular Yii framework, LUYA offers a clear and modular architecture that can easily be extended to any needs.
- console commands for scaffolding, content synchronization, deployment and other tasks let developers (and clients) save time and money.
- pro-active error reporting helps discovering and ironing out bugs.
- LUYA is well-tested and includes state-of-the-art security measures.
- a comprehensive and continually extended guide and API documentation makes learning the ins and outs of LUYA a breeze.
- the administration UI is clearly structured and easy to use for clients (customers).
- LUYA is and will always be free to use.

## What LUYA never will be

+ LUYA is not intended to unpack on a webserver and follow a graphical step by step setup process, like wordpress or any other cms systems. LUYA is built for developers which should use VCS and deployment tools.
+ We will never add a WYSIWYG editor. You can either create your own block with WYSIWYG editor or use a community extension.
